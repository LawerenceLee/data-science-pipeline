To understand why, suppose you have a highly imbalanced dataset of assembly line information where 99% of your labels are \"not defect\". If you train your model on the dataset, it will be incredibly familiar with what constitutes \"not defect\" and have little information on what constitutes \"defect\". Put it another way, the class priors are biased strongly in favor of the majority class. The minority class here suffers from the problem of where there isn't enough data point to influence the classifier to correct misclassification on the minority class."
